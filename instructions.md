# The problem
We need to develop an application that helps in controlling brand new mowers from the factory.
Rolled out brand new robotic mowers are able to cut the grass and to inspect the terrain with their cameras to identify problems in the green areas.
Our robotic mowers are awesome!

The factory has a lot of green spaces but for the MVP, we will consider only one single green grass plateau to simply the problem.
Picture from a small part of the Factory

A green grass plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the mowers so they can cut the grass and that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send to the Maintenance Office.

A mower’s position and location are represented by a combination of X and Y coordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points (N, E, S, W). The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the mower is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

In order to control a mower, SEAT Maintenance Office sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are “L”, “R” and ”M”. “L” and “R” make the mower spin 90 degrees left or  right respectively, without moving from its current spot. “M” means to move forward one grid point and maintain the same Heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (X, Y) is (X, Y + 1).

## Input
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the bottom-left coordinates are assumed to be 0, 0.

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the mowers that have been deployed. Each mower has two lines of input. The first line gives the mower’s position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the mower how to explore the plateau. The  position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the  X and Y coordinates and the mower’s orientation.

Each mower will be finished sequentially, which means that the second mower won’t start to move until the first one has finished moving.

## Output
The output for each mower should be its final coordinates and heading.
